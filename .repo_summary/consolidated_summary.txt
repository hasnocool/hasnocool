Here's the structured summary of your project "Hasnocool":

1. **Project Name:** Hasnocool
2. **Short Description:** A Python-based project that automates updating README.md files with project and WakaTime statistics.
3. **Overall Description:**
The "Hasnocool" project leverages various technologies to create innovative solutions, particularly in the context of software development. At its core, it involves using scripts to update README.md files within a repository by incorporating information about projects and programming languages used over the last 7 days via WakaTime API.

This process is achieved through two primary Python scripts: `update_readme.py` and `update_wakatime.py`. The former updates the README.md file with project sections based on data from `repos.json`, while the latter fetches WakaTime statistics to display programming language breakdowns within the README.md file. This allows developers to easily visualize their coding habits and productivity metrics.
4. **Main Purpose:** To automate updating README.md files with relevant information about projects and coding habits, enhancing transparency and self-discovery for software developers.
5. **Key Technologies:**
   - Python
   - JSON
   - Base64 encoding/decoding
   - WakaTime API integration
6. **Unique Features:**
   - Ability to fetch and display WakaTime statistics in README.md files
   - Automatic project section updates in README.md based on data from `repos.json`
7. **Future Improvements:**
   - Integration with more APIs or services for broader insights
   - Customization options for how projects are displayed in README.md
8. **Personal Notes:** "This project started as a personal experiment to automate repetitive tasks but has grown into something that can genuinely help developers visualize their productivity and preferences."
9. **GitHub Tags:** automation, software development, README generator, WakaTime API, Python scripts, productivity metrics, coding habits.
10. **Installable Modules:** base64, os, json, requests
11. **Suggested Folder Names:** scripts, data, repositories, statistics, project_updates
12. **Root Project Folder Name Suggestions:** Hasnocool, DevTools, READMEUpdater, ProductivityTracker, CodingInsights
